    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the more common questions I get at Mobilikd is for recommendations for an inexpensive mobile radio that would be good for use with APRS or 1200 baud packet.  That has not been something I have ever felt qualified to answer.  To date Mobilinkd only provides cables for mobile ham radios with a standard MiniDIN-6 data port.  *Les Poston WY0GTR* over at [HamMadeParts](http://www.hammadeparts.com) makes cables that work with our TNCs for a number of other ham radios.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have done a [review the the ubiquitous KT-8900D](http://www.mobilinkd.com/2017/05/27/a-brief-review-of-the-kt-8900d/), which is rebranded under many makes and models, and discussed [why it is unsuitable for APRS](http://www.mobilinkd.com/2017/05/28/kt-8900d-review-follow-up-1/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently I started to get interested in this question for another reason.  I have been working on adding 9600 baud support to the TNC3.  And to do 9600 baud, you really need a mobile radio.  The only hand-held radios capable of 9600 baud have built-in TNCs and are rather expensive.  And all of the mobile radios that are 9600 baud capable are fairly expensive as well.  Partly inspired by the guys at [TARPN](http://tarpn.net/t/packet_radio_networking.html), I wanted to see what was possible for under $100 in the US.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means foregoing ham radios and going for used commercial gear.\n",
    "\n",
    "And the focus is going to be on finding radios for dedicated to APRS/packet use rather than a do-it-all radio. These are radios you can put in the trunk of your car, or set up as a packet node or digipeater.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of their nature they won't have VFO knobs, or allow you to enter a specific frequency.  They are channelized.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motorola Radius SM50\n",
    "\n",
    "One inexpensive radio I ran across on eBay was the one pictured above.  It is a Motorola Radius SM50 which I purchased for $30.  I had hopes that it could work for 9600 baud as it has flat audio input and output on an accessory port.  But even if it was not capable of 9600 baud, it might be a great radio for APRS.\n",
    "\n",
    "I did a little research at the [Repeater Builder website](http://www.repeater-builder.com/motorola/sm50/sm50.html).  There was a lot of detailed information about this radio, including a service manual with full schematics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Variations\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two very similar models in this series -- the SM50, which is a 2-channel radio, and the SM120, which is a 16 channel radio.  For this discussion, either will work for a dedicated APRS or packet radio.\n",
    "\n",
    "More importantly, there are UHF and VHF versions of this radio.  The one we need for APRS is the VHF version.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, there are 25 watt and 40 watt variants.  These can all be determined based on the model number.  The [Repeater Builder page](http://www.repeater-builder.com/motorola/sm50/sm50.html) has breakdown of what each component of the model number means.  In the end, you want one of these four models:\n",
    "\n",
    " * M33DGC20A2AA  (SM50 VHF 25W)\n",
    " * M43DGC20A2AA  (SM50 VHF 40W)\n",
    " * M33DGC20C2AA  (SM120 VHF 25W)\n",
    " * M43DGC20C2AA  (SM120 VHF 40W)\n",
    "\n",
    "I really like the simplicity of the two-channel SM50.\n",
    "\n",
    "### eBay Pricing\n",
    "\n",
    "The radio pictured above is the exact radio I purchased for $30.  That is a reasonable price for the radio.  But there are people trying to get $100 or more for these radios.  They just are not worth much more then $30-40 ($40 for the 40W SM120) unless they come with needed accessories (see below).  The reason is that these are commercial (FCC Part 90) and there are a bunch of land mobile radios on the market as municipalities switch over to newer digital radios.\n",
    "\n",
    "For $100 (even for $60) you can get a much better radio.  I'll do a separate article on radios in this price range.\n",
    "\n",
    "If someone is trying to sell one at a high price, don't be afraid to offer them what its worth.  Lots of people sell stuff on eBay with no clue as to its actual worth.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[Note: this is written in Spring of 2020.  Pricing can change dramatically over time.\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Accessories\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the things to note is that I purchased the radio you see at the top of the page.  Nothing more, nothing less.  This means that things you might get with a new radio were missing.  I did not get a microphone.  I did not get a power cable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Antenna Adapter\n",
    "\n",
    "The radio has a Mini-UHF connector for the antenna.  I don't have any Mini-UHF adapters or cables.  I purchased a *Mini-UHF to BNC* adapter for $5.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Mini-UHF to BNC adapter](MiniUHF.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Power Cable\n",
    "\n",
    "The radio has a standard SAE power connector.  These are common in the US.  I didn't really need one while it was on the bench.  I plugged it into a bench supply using alligator clips.  But I will likely put this in a vehicle, so I purchased a power cable.  These are also about $10.\n",
    "\n",
    "![SAE Power Cable](SAEPower.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Microphone\n",
    "\n",
    "For APRS, one does not really need a microphone.  I bought one anyway.  I don't have a Motorola mic in the lab and I wanted to see how well this radio would work for APRS Voice Alert.  These can be found for about $10 new.  These plug in to a standard RJ-45 connector at the front of the radio.\n",
    "\n",
    "![RJ-45 Microphone](RJ45Mic.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Programming Cable\n",
    "\n",
    "I built a programming cable using parts I had in the lab. More on that later.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "All in, I spent another $25.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hardware Walkthough\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a quick look at the hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Front\n",
    "\n",
    "<table>\n",
    "  <tr>\n",
    "    <td> <img src=\"SM50_Front.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 800px;\"/> </td>\n",
    "    <td> <img src=\"FrontCloseUp.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/> </td>\n",
    "  </tr>\n",
    "</table>\n",
    "\n",
    "On the front we have the following features:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. A power/volume control knob.\n",
    " 1. An RJ-45 jack for a speaker-mic and for programming.\n",
    " 1. A monitor button to either ignore PL tones and use carrier squelch or open squelch completely.\n",
    " 1. Two channel selector buttons.  On the SM50 they are labeled 1/2 and on the SM120 they are up/down.  These are also referred to as \"modes\" by Motorola.\n",
    " 1. An option button whose function can be programmed by the user.\n",
    " 1. A channel/mode indicator.\n",
    " 1. Indicators for option and monitor indicators.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rear\n",
    "\n",
    "<table>\n",
    "  <tr>\n",
    "    <td> <img src=\"SM50_Rear.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 800px;\"/> </td>\n",
    "    <td> <img src=\"RearConnector.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/> </td>\n",
    "  </tr>\n",
    "</table>\n",
    "\n",
    "On the rear we have three notable items:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. The MiniUHF antenna connector.\n",
    " 1. The power cable with SAE connector.\n",
    " 1. The 16-pin accessory port.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is really the business end of the radio for APRS use and where we will focus most of our attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Antenna Connector\n",
    "\n",
    "There is not a lot of cables or antennas for the ham bands that use MiniUHF.  You will want to get an adapter for either SO-239 (female UHF) or, my preference, female BNC.  I picked up a male mini-UHF to female BNC for under $5.  You can find them for under $2 from China -- including postage.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Power Connector\n",
    "\n",
    "My radio came with an intact power cable.  Unfortunately you see a lot of these radio where it looks like someone just cut the cable while removing it from the last vehicle it was in.  Repairing a power cable is trivial.  And you can get replacement cables for these radios for under $10.  Just search for \"Motorola 3080486U01 Power Cable with Strain Relief\".\n",
    "\n",
    "These cables have a polarity to them.  If you buy a power cord for it, make sure the polarity is correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Accessory Port\n",
    "\n",
    "The accessory port is one of the things that drew me to the radio.  The pins have a standard 0.1\" (2.54mm) spacing.  You can plug standard DuPont connectors into these pins.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also get locking connectors for these ports for about $2 on DigiKey. These are [TE Connectivity 104422](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/te-connectivity-amp-connectors/104422-1/104422-1-ND/289312) connectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The accessory port has a number of standard pins such as audio input and output, PTT, GND, speaker, ignition sense, and carrier squelch detect.  It also has a number of progammable IO pins.  You can add an auxilliary PTT signal, for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "It has flat audio input.  The audio output can be programmed to be either squelched and de-emphasized or open with a flat response.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a full pinout of this port, please refer to the detailed description on the [SM50 information page](http://www.repeater-builder.com/motorola/sm50/sm50.html) at the Repeater Builder website.\n",
    "\n",
    "For APRS and packet use, we are going to make use of pins 5,7,9,11, which are the top, middle 4 pins.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two invaluable resources for information on the radio hardware, both at the Repeater Builder website.\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. http://www.repeater-builder.com/motorola/sm50/sm50.html This is the main SM50 information page.\n",
    " 2. http://www.repeater-builder.com/motorola/manuals/sm50+sm120-svc-man-6880903z45-a.pdf The service manual for the radios."

    "## Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming the radio is probably one of the bigger challenges for people.  The software to program it is [not exactly freely available](http://www.hackersrussia.ru/Radio/m_motorola.php).  And it was made 25+ years ago for MS-DOS.\n",
    "\n",
    "But I am here to tell you that I made a programming cable for next to $0 with parts I had in a junk drawer, and got the programming software working under [DOSBox](https://www.dosbox.com/wiki/Main_Page) on Linux.\n",
    "\n",
    "When talking about Motorola radios you'll see a lot of talk about RSS, code plugs, and RIBs.  It's good to know what these terms mean, but I am going to stick to common terminology and avoid jargon.  RSS is the programming software, code plugs are just radio configuration data, and RIBs are programming cables.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, let's get started!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Programming Cable\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming cables for these radios can be purchased from various online source.  But they are also very easy to make using a USB UART adapter, a 1N4148 diode, and an Ethernet cable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The progamming interface uses a one-wire serial bus.  Our programming cable has to convert a two-wire serial bus into a one-wire signal.  The protocol used on the Motorola is as simple as it gets, where the transmitter receives everything it sends.\n",
    "\n",
    "*George Smart M1GEO* has a [schematic diagram](https://www.george-smart.co.uk/scrapbook/gm300_cables/) for a programmer that works really well.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Programming Cable](ProgrammingCable.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As simple as it is, I still managed to struggle a bit with it because the labels for TX/RX on the UART adapter are swapped.  In the image above you can see the blue/white wire connected to ground (GND), the diode bridging TX and RX UART pins, and the orange wire connected to RX.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are seeing this nicely soldered together.  But when I was initially figuring out the radio on the bench, this was all done on a breadboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can buy a RIB on Amazon or eBay and pay $20-40, or you can make one for next to nothing with parts from your junk drawer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Programming Software\n",
    "\n",
    "To program the SM50, you will need to google for \"RSS SM50\".  I provided a link above to a site that has the software.  This is DOS-based software.  In this section I am going to show you how to configure DOSBox, run the software, make some required changes so we can program frequencies in the 2m ham band, and then program the radio for 2m APRS.\n",
