    "The Motorola Radius SM-series radios are discontinued land-mobile radios (FCC Part 90) that are available used for under $50. The VHF models can be converted to work on th 2m band, making them an inexpensive option for a dedicated APRS radio.\n",
    "\n",
    "This article goes over the features of the radio, what you will need to set it up as a dedicated APRS/packet radio, how to program it for the 2m ham band, and my failed attempt to make it work for 9600 baud.\n",
    "\n",
    "Making these work isn't for everyone.  You have to be a little technically adventurous.  But if you want a mobile packet radio for very little money, this could be for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are still reading, this article assumes you can read and understand basic schematic diagrams, have a soldering iron, can build your own cables, and can create basic circuits on a breadboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "The article assumes you will be connecting the radio to a Mobilinkd TNC3, and have another APRS-capable transceiver for testing.  You should also have a dummy load capable of 25W or more, and an RTL SDR.\n",
    "\n",
    "![SM 50 Image](SM50_Front.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the more common questions I get at Mobilinkd is for recommendations for inexpensive mobile radios that would work well for APRS or 1200 baud packet.  That has not been something I have ever felt qualified to answer.  To date Mobilinkd only provides cables for amateur mobile radios with a standard MiniDIN-6 data port.  *Les Poston WY0GTR* over at [HamMadeParts](http://www.hammadeparts.com) makes cables that work with our TNCs for a number of other ham radios.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have done a [review the the ubiquitous KT-8900D](http://www.mobilinkd.com/2017/05/27/a-brief-review-of-the-kt-8900d/), which is rebranded under many names and model numbers, and discussed [why it is unsuitable for APRS](http://www.mobilinkd.com/2017/05/28/kt-8900d-review-follow-up-1/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently I started to get interested in this question of inexpensive mobile radios for another reason.  I have been working on adding 9600 baud support to the TNC3.  And to do 9600 baud, you really need a mobile radio.  The only hand-held radios capable of 9600 baud have built-in TNCs and are rather expensive.  And all of the amateur mobile radios that are 9600 baud capable are fairly expensive as well.  Partly inspired by the folks at [TARPN](http://tarpn.net/t/packet_radio_networking.html), I wanted to see what was possible for under $100 in the US.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means foregoing ham radios and going for used commercial gear.\n",
    "\n",
    "And the focus is going to be on finding radios for dedicated APRS/packet use rather than a do-it-all radio. These are radios you can put in the trunk of your car, or set up as a packet node or digipeater/iGate.  Voice communication is a secondary concern.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of their nature they won't have VFO knobs, or allow you to enter a specific frequency.  They are channelized.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motorola Radius SM50\n",
    "\n",
    "In my search for inexpensive radios that might be usable for 9600 baud, I came across the Motorola Radius SM50 which I was able to purchase for $30.  I had hopes that it could work for 9600 baud as it has flat audio input and output on an accessory port.  But even if it was not capable of 9600 baud, it might be a great radio for APRS.\n",
    "\n",
    "I did a little research at the [Repeater Builder website](http://www.repeater-builder.com/motorola/sm50/sm50.html).  There was a lot of detailed information about this radio, including a service manual with full schematics.  The service manual is a fairly low-resolution image scan, so it is not searchable and some of the images can be difficult to decipher.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Variations\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two very similar models in this series -- the SM50, which is a 2-channel radio, and the SM120, which is a 16 channel radio.  For this discussion, either will work for a dedicated APRS or packet radio.\n",
    "\n",
    "More importantly, there are UHF and VHF versions of this radio.  The one we need for APRS is the VHF version.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, there are 25 watt and 40 watt variants.  These can all be determined based on the model number.  The [Repeater Builder page](http://www.repeater-builder.com/motorola/sm50/sm50.html) has breakdown of what each component of the model number means.  In the end, you want one of these four models:\n",
    "\n",
    " * M33DGC20A2AA  (SM50 VHF 25W) <-- this is the one I purchased.\n",
    " * M43DGC20A2AA  (SM50 VHF 40W)\n",
    " * M33DGC20C2AA  (SM120 VHF 25W)\n",
    " * M43DGC20C2AA  (SM120 VHF 40W)\n",
    "\n",
    "I prefer the simplicity of the two-channel SM50.  But having 16 channels (really 16 \"modes\") offers more flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "### eBay Pricing\n",
    "\n",
    "The radio pictured above is the exact radio I purchased for $30. That is a reasonable price for the radio.  But there are sellers asking more than twice that.  They just are not worth much more than what I payed, maybe a bit more if they come with needed accessories (see below).  The reason is that these are commercial (FCC Part 90) and there are a bunch of land mobile radios on the market as municipalities switch over to newer digital radios.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the $60 price range you can get even better radios.  I'll do a separate article on a radio in this price range later.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a seller is trying to sell one at a high price, don't be afraid to offer them what its worth.  Lots of people sell stuff on eBay with no clue as to its actual worth.  And, in the end, if it is worth $100 to them, they should certainly keep it!\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[Note: this is written in Spring of 2020.  Pricing can change dramatically over time.\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Accessories\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the things to note is that I purchased the radio you see at the top of the page.  Nothing more, nothing less.  This means that things you might get with a new radio were missing.  I did not get a microphone.  I did not get a power cable.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get this working, you going to need to buy a few accessories.\n",
    "\n",
    "<table>\n",
    "  <tr>\n",
    "    <td> <img src=\"MiniUHF.png\" alt=\"Mini-UHF to BNC adapter\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/> </td>\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Antenna Adapter\n",
    "\n",
    "The radio has a mini-UHF connector for the antenna.  I don't have any mini-UHF adapters or cables.  I purchased a *Mini-UHF to BNC* adapter for $5.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Power Cable\n",
    "\n",
    "The radio has an SAE power connector.  These are fairly common in the US.  I didn't really need a power cable while it was on the bench.  I plugged it into a bench supply using alligator clips.  But I will likely put this in a vehicle, so I purchased a power cable.  You can find these [on Amazon](https://amzn.to/33MoIu6) for about $10.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Microphone\n",
    "\n",
    "For APRS, one does not really need a microphone.  I bought one anyway.  I don't have a Motorola mic in the lab and I wanted to see how well this radio would work for APRS Voice Alert.  These can be found for about $10-15 new. [This is the one I purchased](https://amzn.to/2UjM0Ve).  These plug in to a standard RJ-45 connector at the front of the radio.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Programming Cable\n",
    "\n",
    "You can buy a programming cable (called a RIB Box), but they cost almost as much as the radio.  I built a programming cable using parts I had in my junk drawers. Instructions for how to do that are below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "All in, I spent another $30 on parts.  But you can get away with spending less than half that.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hardware Walkthough\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a quick look at the hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Front\n",
    "\n",
    "<table>\n",
    "  <tr>\n",
    "    <td> <img src=\"SM50_Front.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 800px;\"/> </td>\n",
    "    <td> <img src=\"FrontCloseUp.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/> </td>\n",
    "  </tr>\n",
    "</table>\n",
    "\n",
    "On the front we have the following features:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. A power/volume control knob.\n",
    " 1. An RJ-45 jack for a speaker-mic and for programming.\n",
    " 1. A monitor button to either ignore PL tones and use carrier squelch or open squelch completely.\n",
    " 1. Two channel selector buttons.  On the SM50 they are labeled 1/2 and on the SM120 they are up/down.  These are also referred to as \"modes\" by Motorola.\n",
    " 1. An option button whose function can be programmed by the user.\n",
    " 1. A channel/mode indicator.\n",
    " 1. Indicators for option and monitor indicators.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rear\n",
    "\n",
    "<table>\n",
    "  <tr>\n",
    "    <td> <img src=\"SM50_Rear.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 800px;\"/> </td>\n",
    "    <td> <img src=\"RearConnector.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/> </td>\n",
    "  </tr>\n",
    "</table>\n",
    "\n",
    "On the rear we have three notable items:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. The MiniUHF antenna connector.\n",
    " 1. The power cable with SAE connector.\n",
    " 1. The 16-pin accessory port.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is really the business end of the radio for APRS use and where we will focus most of our attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Antenna Connector\n",
    "\n",
    "There is not a lot of cables or antennas for the ham bands that use MiniUHF.  You will want to get an adapter for either SO-239 (female UHF) or, my preference, female BNC.  I picked up a male mini-UHF to female BNC for under $5.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find them for under $2 from China -- including postage.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should go without saying that you will also need an antenna for the radio.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Power Connector\n",
    "\n",
    "My radio came with an intact power cable.  Unfortunately you see a lot of these radios where it looks like someone just cut the cable while removing it from the last vehicle it was in.  Repairing a power cable is trivial.  And you can get replacement cables for these radios for under $10.  Just search for \"Motorola 3080486U01 Power Cable with Strain Relief\".\n",
    "\n",
    "These cables have a polarity to them.  If you buy a power cord for it, make sure the polarity is correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are soldered to the board, so you will need a soldering iron to replace the cable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Accessory Port\n",
    "\n",
    "The accessory port is one of the things that drew me to the radio.  The pins have a standard 0.1\" (2.54mm) spacing.  You can plug standard DuPont connectors into these pins.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also get locking connectors for these ports for about \\\\$2 on DigiKey. These are [TE Connectivity 104422](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/te-connectivity-amp-connectors/104422-1/104422-1-ND/289312) connectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The accessory port has a number of standard pins such as audio input and output, PTT, GND, speaker, ignition sense, and carrier squelch detect.  It also has a number of progammable IO pins.  You can add an auxilliary PTT signal, for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "It has flat audio input.  The audio output can be programmed to be either squelched and de-emphasized or open with a flat response.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a full pinout of this port, please refer to the detailed description on the [SM50 information page](http://www.repeater-builder.com/motorola/sm50/sm50.html) at the Repeater Builder website.\n",
    "\n",
    "For APRS and packet use, we are going to make use of pins 5,7,9,11, which are the top, middle 4 pins.  You may need to use 2,3,7,11 for Voice Alert.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two invaluable resources for information on the radio hardware, both at the Repeater Builder website.\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. http://www.repeater-builder.com/motorola/sm50/sm50.html This is the main SM50 information page.\n",
    " 2. http://www.repeater-builder.com/motorola/manuals/sm50+sm120-svc-man-6880903z45-a.pdf The service manual for the radios.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming the radio is probably one of the bigger challenges for people.  The software to program it is [not exactly freely available](http://www.hackersrussia.ru/Radio/m_motorola.php).  And it was made 25+ years ago for MS-DOS.\n",
    "\n",
    "But I am here to tell you that I made a programming cable for next to \\\\$0 with parts I had in my junk drawers, and got the programming software working under [DOSBox](https://www.dosbox.com/wiki/Main_Page) on Linux.\n",
    "\n",
    "When talking about Motorola radios you'll see a lot of talk about RSS, code plugs, and RIBs.  It's good to know what these terms mean, but I am going to stick to common terminology and avoid Motorola jargon.  RSS is the programming software, code plugs are just radio configuration data, and RIBs are programming cables.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, let's get started!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Programming Cable\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming cables for these radios can be purchased from various online sources.  But they are not exactly cheap.  They are also very easy to make using a USB UART adapter, a 1N4148 diode, and an old RJ-45 Ethernet cable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The progamming interface uses a one-wire serial bus.  Our programming cable has to convert a two-wire serial bus into a one-wire signal.  The protocol used on the Motorola is as simple as it gets, where the transmitter receives everything it sends.\n",
    "\n",
    "*George Smart M1GEO* has a [schematic diagram](https://www.george-smart.co.uk/scrapbook/gm300_cables/) for a programmer that works really well.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Programming Cable](ProgrammingCable.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Things yourll need:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. A USB to TTL UART.  It needs to be able to handle 3.3V & 5V.\n",
    " 1. A general purpose switching diode, such as the 1N4148.  Just about any will work.\n",
    " 1. An old Ethernet cable with an RJ-45 connector.\n",
    " 1. A DMM or continuity tester with sharp probes.\n",
    " \n",
    "If you want to solder it like I did, you'll need a soldering iron, some solder, and maybe some shrink tubing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Review the instructions from M1GEO's site linked above.  In the image above you can see the blue/white wire connected to ground (GND), the diode bridging TX and RX UART pins, and the orange wire connected to RX.  As simple as it is, I still managed to struggle a bit with it because the labels for TX/RX on the UART adapter I used are swapped.\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Cut one end off the Ethernet cable.  If it is a long one, just cut the length you need.\n",
    " 1. Strip off about 2cm of the the outer insulation from the bare end.\n",
    " 1. Find the solid orange and white/blue wires.\n",
    " 1. Stip about 1cm of insulation from the orange and white/blue wires.\n",
    " 1. Use a continuity tester to verify the two wires correspond with the connections on the RJ-45 connector shown [here](https://www.george-smart.co.uk/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/GM300_Programming_Schematic.png).  Pin 2 of the RJ-45 should be orange and pin 5 should be blue/white.\n",
    "     1. If these do not match up, you have a non-standard cable and need to find out what color wires match these pins.  In this document I will be referring to them as orange and blue/white.\n",
    " 1. Connect the blue/white wire to ground on the USB UART device.\n",
    " 1. Connect the orange wire to the RX pin.\n",
    " 1. Connect the diode between the TX and RX pins, with the cathode (the stripe) towards the TX pin.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The one you see above is nicely soldered together.  But when I was initially figuring out the radio on the bench, this was all done on a breadboard.  If you are just going to program one radio, it doesn't have to be well-engineered.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can buy a RIB on Amazon or eBay and pay \\\\$20-40, or you can make one for next to nothing with parts from your junk drawer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Programming Software\n",
    "\n",
    "*As we go through the programming steps, I am going to be using Fedora Linux.  You will need to adjust these commands to suit your operating system of choice.*\n",
    "\n",
    "To program the SM50, you will need to google for \"RSS SM50\".  I provided a link above to a site that has the software.  This is DOS-based software.  In this section I am going to show you how to configure DOSBox, run the software, make some required changes so we can program frequencies in the 2m ham band, and then program the radio for 2m APRS.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Download the Programming Software\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to download the [SM50/SM120 R04.00.00 RSS](http://www.hackersrussia.ru/block/radio/Sm50_1.zip) from [this repository](http://www.hackersrussia.ru/Radio/m_motorola.php).\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a directory under your home directory called SM50 (for me, that's `/home/rob/SM50`), download and unzip the\n",
    "file there.\n",
    "\n",
    "    mkdir ~/SM50\n",
    "    cd ~/SM50\n",
    "    wget http://www.hackersrussia.ru/block/radio/Sm50_1.zip\n",
    "    unzip Sm50_1.zip\n",
    "\n",
    "After you unzip the ZIP file, you will find a self-extracting archive called SM.EXE.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step is to plug in your programming cable and determine the device name assigned.  For me that's `/dev/ttyUSB5` or `/dev/serial/by-id/usb-Silicon_Labs_CP2102_USB_to_UART_Bridge_Controller_0001-if00-port0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Leave the programming cable plugged in.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Installing & Configuring DOSBox\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, if you don't already have DOSBox installed, install it:\n",
    "\n",
    "    sudo dnf install dosbox\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we need to start DOSBox at least once.  When you start up DOSBox the first time, it will create a configuration file in `~/.dosbox/dosbox-0.74-3.conf`.  We need to edit this file.  If that file (or one with a similar version number) does not exist, start DOSBox and then just close the window that opens.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to edit the config file.\n",
    "\n",
    "    gedit ~/.dosbox/dosbox-0.74-3.conf &\n",
    "    \n",
    "Specifically, we need to edit two sections near the end.  The first is the `[serial]` section.\n",
    "\n",
    "    [serial]\n",
    "    serial1=directserial realport:serial/by-id/usb-Silicon_Labs_CP2102_USB_to_UART_Bridge_Controller_0001-if00-port0\n",
    "\n",
    "Change the device to match your own.  This maps our USB serial device to COM1 on DOS.  Note that the `/dev/` prefix is missing from the path.  You can also do:\n",
    "\n",
    "    serial1=directserial realport:ttyUSB5\n",
    "\n",
    "The drawback with this method is that you may have to change it frequently if you change USB connections regularly. You will end up with different tty port assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next section we need to change is the `[autoexec]` section.\n",
    "\n",
    "    [autoexec]\n",

Fine tuning this level can be a bit challenging in the app. Just know that it does not have to be perfect.  Setting the output level a little bit higher than the perfect Null is OK.  This provides almost 3kHz deviation.  Since we are using the pre-emphasis, the 2200Hz tone will have higher deviation -- somewhere closer to 3.3kHz.\n",

The oscilloscope was set to 180us delay and 1s persistence.  This delay causes the trigger to occur a number of bit periods before the display.  What we see on the screen is the waveform 180us after the trigger.\n",

However, the signal that was present at the *flat audio output* pin of the accessory port on the back was not.  It seemed as if there was a high-pass filter in the audio path that was affecting the low frequency response.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Transmit Audio\n",
    "\n",
    "Transmit audio was a bit trickier.  It turns out that flat TX audio isn't flat, and is completely attenuated beyond 3kHz.  The audio is routed through the AFIC (Motorola's audio processor IC) U402.  There are multiple paths depending on whether the MIC PTT is pressed or an auxilliary PTT signal is used, and whether pre- or post-limiter is selected in the audio path configuration when setting up the accessory port.  None of those options provided clean, unfiltered access to the the VCO.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the tricks used to make the GM300 support 9600 baud is to bypass the AFIC [as described here](http://www.redwaveradio.com/5_7487f484c875f483_1.htm).  I found a similar path on the SM50.\n",

    "  </tr>\n",
    "</table>\n",
    "\n",
    "This routes the signal when an auxilliary PTT is used around the AFIC and straight into the VCO.  I could not quite get R671 into the image through the microscope.  Luckily, R671 and R655 & R656 are on the same side of the PCB and near each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "This worked!  I could now send and receive data at 9600 baud.\n",
    "\n",
    "But something was not right.  When I went to fine tune the deviation on the radio using an RTL-SDR and GQRX, I observed the TX frequency jumping around +/- almost 3kHz.\n",

    "<table>\n",
    "  <tr>\n",

    "</table>\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these transmissions should line up perfectly.  This is a 1200Hz tone being sent in multiple bursts.\n",
    "\n",
    "When transmitting just a carrier, by triggering PTT with the output level set to 0, the carrier is always centered on the expected transmit frequency (within its specification).\n",
    "\n",
    "What I believe happens is that the AFIC suppresses the modulation output until after the VCO PLL locks.  The radio always transmits on the proper frequency after modifying the firmware in the TNC to key the transmitter and wait about 60ms (determined empirically) before sending the preamble (TX Delay) and the HDLC frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "But that is not done on any TNC that I am aware of.  What happens (or what is *specified to happen*) is that the transmitter is keyed and either IDLE or FLAG bytes are immediately sent (the standard says FLAG, but there are advantages to sending IDLE).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in the end I abandoned my attempt to use this radio for 9600 baud.\n",
    "\n",
    "The good news is that reverting the change on the TX side eliminated the problem and allowed me to complete the 1200 baud section above using both flat and pre-emphasised TX audio.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The SM50 is a fine radio for 1200 baud APRS when it can be found for a reasonable price.  Accessories are easy to come by and inexpensive.  The programming cable is easy to make.  The programming software runs easily in DOSbox on virtually any platform.  And the accessory connector allows the use common Dupont connectors when constructing a cable.\n",
    "\n",
    "While it is unsuitable for 9600 baud operation, the radio is still a very good value for a dedicated mobile APRS radio.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is further research to be done if there are other modifications possible to achieve 9600 baud without the problems docuemented here.  And it may be worth researching whether adding an additional \"modulation delay\" parameter to a TNC, where PTT is engaged without modulation for some time period, would be a generally useful feature to implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "As others have documented a [similar modification to Motorola MaxTrac radios](http://motorolamaxtrac.blogspot.com/2014/02/maxtrac-radius-9600-baud-packet.html), it may be worthwhile to investigate whether similar transmit frequency errors occur with these radios and, if not, how the problem is avoided in these radios.\n",
    "\n",
    "I would like to encourage radio manufacturers to make the software required to program their radios publicly and freely available to radio amateurs when the radio equipment is no longer an economically viable products.  Requiring that radio amateurs download software from unofficial sites in order to program their equipment is undesireable.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, I would also encourage more radio amateurs to take on the task of decoding the programming protocols of these radios and providing open software for programming them.  [Chirp](https://chirp.danplanet.com/projects/chirp/wiki/Home) is a great resource for a large number of radios.\n",
    "\n",
    "But since Motorola apparently [encrypts the data between programmer and radio](https://chirp.danplanet.com/issues/1333), it seems will not be an option for owners of Motorola equipment unless Motorola themselves step forward to addres."
